# "New Horizons"
Browser-based dynamically-mixed music. Best experienced with headphones.

Music created by myself. The system plays back aleatoric variations of several looping tracks as well as a series of one-offs, both ambient and melodic. Creates a spatialized binaural scene using Resonance Audio SDK and the Web Audio API. System resets after each "stop." Visuals via particles.js. Named after the NASA probe; the idea originally came from another (abandonded) project and it seemed good enough to keep.

This is both an experiment in creating a "dense" audio scene, as well as a learning experience (first time using the Web Audio API). Doesn't work well on mobile browsers. Currently considering this to be a fossil - will make improvements on future projects, but this will stay "as-is."
